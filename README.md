# Trivia-Score-Tracker
This is a python program I devised to keep track of trivia scores. It came about during the beginning of quarantine when my friends and I began playing weekly trivia games via zoom. I quickly realized how cumbersome it was to keep score via Excel or with pen and paper so I wrote up this quick program to do the heavy lifting. 

### How to Run It ### 
In order to play you will need to download this file:

[python file]

You will need to have Python and Idle to run the program. They can be downloaded from this page:

* Open the triviaScorer2 in IDLE and select run (or pres f5). 
  * This will open the program shell and give the following prompt: 
  
![Teams](https://github.com/danemd/Trivia-Score-Tracker/blob/images/teams.png)

* Input the team name then hit *enter*. When you are finished entering teams hit *enter* again. 

![Number of Rounds](https://github.com/danemd/Trivia-Score-Tracker/blob/images/num_rounds_team_add.png)

* You will be prompted with a number of rounds to play, enter the appropriate number and hit *enter*. 
  * Following this prompt you will be asked to enter in more teams (this is to catch any latecomers to the game.) If there are none hit *enter* again. 

![Scores](https://github.com/danemd/Trivia-Score-Tracker/blob/images/scores.png)

* Now you will be prompted to enter the scores. Input the appropriate scores for each team, hit *enter* again, and then the team standings will be displayed in descending order. 

### That's it, have fun! ###
